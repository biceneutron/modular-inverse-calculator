### Run
1. To run the programme, ensure you are using Python3.x, and
- For OS X
```sh
$ python find_inverse.py
```
- For Windows
```sh
$ py find_inverse.py
```
2. Input a number, and the programme will calculate the inverse of this number with modular 2**1279 - 1
3. If your input and 2**1279-1 are not relatively prime integers, the programme will exit.
4. If the process of calculating gcd contains just one equation, the problem connot be solved by Extended Euclidean Algorithm. So the programme exit and please check out the online modular inverse calculator https://planetcalc.com/3311/.
